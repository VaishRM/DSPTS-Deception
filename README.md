# DSPTS-Deception

This report presents the findings of a study investigating the physiological correlates of deception. The aim was to analyze various physiological parameters extracted from two groups of subjects who engaged in deception during different blocks of the experiment. The approach involved programmatically extracting features from each signal and using these parameters to test for differences in physiological responses related to deception.
